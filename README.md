# TechAhoy Workshops
TechAhoy Inc. is a non-profit community space on the Queens/Brooklyn border where children and adults of all backgrounds and experience levels can learn about computer programming, robotics, art, and technology in a creative, collaborative, and inclusive setting. We embrace the DIY philosophy and encourage community members to create, tinker, and explore.

Our workshops are for beginners and experienced coders alike and we encourage parent involvement in our CodeTogether series where parents can learn to code with their children while practicing [pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
