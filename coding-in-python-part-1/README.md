# Pomodorro Timer
The Pomodorro Technique was created in the early 1990's by developer, entrepreneur,
and author Francesco Cirillo. It is very popular in the computer science
industry. The motivating idea behind the technique is to work very hard for
25 minutes, then take a well deserved 5 minute rest. Complete this cycle 4
times and then take a longer break... maybe 15 minutes and resume.

This project creates a pomodorro timer out of an Adafruit Trinket M0 ($9), a
push button (<$1) and 5 LEDs. Note the at the code in this repository is
written for a push button that this "always open." Also, please be aware of the
pinout for the Trinket M0 as the analog pins do not correspond to the painted
labels.

Next steps:
1)  upload stl files for the timer's 3d printed case
2)  incorporate a piezo alarm to sound when the session is over!
