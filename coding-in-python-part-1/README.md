# Pomodorro Timer
The Pomodorro Technique was created in the early 1990's by developer, entrepreneur,
and author Francesco Cirillo. It is very popular in the computer science
industry. The motivating idea behind the technique is to work very hard for
25 minutes, then take a well deserved 5 minute rest. Complete this cycle 4
times and then take a longer break... maybe 15 minutes and resume.

This project creates a pomodorro timer out of an [Adafruit Trinket M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500), a
push button, and 5 LEDs.

## Workshop Details
* The workshop slides are available to [download as a PDF](https://github.com/techahoynyc/workshops/raw/master/coding-in-python-part-1/Tomato%20Timer%20Using%20Python.pdf)
* The **imports** referenced in the workshop, which were preinstalled on the Trinket M0, can be found in the [lib](https://github.com/techahoynyc/workshops/tree/master/coding-in-python-part-1/lib) folder.
* When building future projects for the Trinket M0, always use the most recent version of [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org/board/trinket_m0/) and its corresponding [libraries](https://circuitpython.org/libraries). Detailed installation instructions can be found on the [Adafruit Trinket M0 Learn Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino/circuitpython).

## Notes:
*The at the code in this repository is written for a push button that this "always open."  
Also, please be aware of the pinout for the Trinket M0 as the analog pins do not correspond to the painted labels.*
